# PixelTalk
PixelTalk is a web platform inspired by the aesthetics and design philosophies of early 2000s to 2010s websites. It aims to recreate the nostalgic experience of old-school internet culture, blending vintage UI elements with modern functionalities. The project is part of a hackathon challenge focused on reviving retro web experiences.
